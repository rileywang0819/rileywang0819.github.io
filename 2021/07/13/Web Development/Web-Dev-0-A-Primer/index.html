<h2 id="Networks"><a href="#Networks" class="headerlink" title="Networks"></a>Networks</h2><h3 id="What-is-the-Web"><a href="#What-is-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="What is the Web?"></a>What is the Web?</h3><p>The web is a network spread across the globe that connects a multitude of devices and allows them to communicate with one another. </p>
<p>Websites on the Internet are hosted on devices referred to as <strong>servers</strong> , the device that you’re accessing the webpage is referred to as the <strong>client</strong>. When you’re interacting with a webpage on the Internet, what you’re essentially doing is exchanging data with the server. The web enables the exchange of data between clients and servers.</p>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the <strong>Web</strong>, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by <code>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/)</code>, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web are transferred via the <code>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</code>, may be accessed by users by a software application called a <code>web browser</code>, and are published by a software application called a <code>web server</code>. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, Web can be seen as one of services provided by the Internet.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="Network-layers"><a href="#Network-layers" class="headerlink" title="Network layers"></a>Network layers</h4><img src="/2021/07/13/Web%20Development/Web-Dev-0-A-Primer/Internet-layer.jpg" class="" title="Network Layers">


<p>The network are typically divided into abstract layers, each of which performs a specific task that aids in the overall communication process:</p>
<p>(from the bottom layer up to the topmost layer)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Application Layer:</strong> is responsible for process-to-process communication across the Internet. The application itself is built on top of this layer. The application layer provides a communication interface and end-user services to the application for its communication with single processes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> is responsible for connecting applications on the Internet. It demultiplexes(解复用) data coming in from a single source and transmits it to the application it is intended for. The basic purpose of the transport layer in the context of the web is that it provides process-to-process communication; it allows two individual processes on either the same machine or separate machines to send messages to each other. To do so, it uses <strong>sockets(套接字)</strong>, which are essentially just the gateway to a process. In other words, sockets are the means through which messages are received and sent out by a process.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Network Layer:</strong> is responsible for connecting any two machines on the Internet, allows for end-systems to commnunicate with each other on a large scale</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Link Layer:</strong> is responsible for transimitting data from one device to another device that is <strong>exactly one line away</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Layer:</strong> physical wiring and circuits that makes the network works</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each layer is built on top of the previous layer. And each layer has <code>protocols</code> that implement specific functionalities that are involved in the data exchange process.</p>
<h3 id="How-does-Web-work"><a href="#How-does-Web-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Web work?"></a>How does Web work?</h3><p>We have already know that clients send messages to servers requesting data, and servers respond with the required data. but how is this data transferred?</p>
<p>To answer this question, first, we will define the structure of the Internet. Then talk about how data is transported across the network.</p>
<img src="/2021/07/13/Web%20Development/Web-Dev-0-A-Primer/internet-structure.png" class="">

<h4 id="1-Switches"><a href="#1-Switches" class="headerlink" title="1. Switches"></a>1. Switches</h4><p>The Internet is comprised of devices known as <strong>switches(交换机)</strong> that facilitate the connection of each device to every other device on the network. The devices themselves are referred to as end-systems. End-systems are connected to switches through <strong>links</strong> and all of the switches are, in turn, connected to each other. Thus ensuring that every end-system on the Internet is implicitly connected to every other end-system.</p>
<p>In addition to connecting end-systems to one another, switches facilitate the communication between any two end-systems by forwarding packets(转发数据包) along the path that they know exists between the packet source and destination. So basically, switches store pre-determined paths between end-systems and forwards packets among them.</p>
<h4 id="2-Routers"><a href="#2-Routers" class="headerlink" title="2. Routers"></a>2. Routers</h4><p><strong>Routers(路由器</strong>) have the same function as switches also connect end systems to the rest of the web. However, routers are actually very different from switches <em>since they have the additional capability of allowing lookups for destination addresses and determining the shortest or the least busy path from the source of a packet to its destination.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Data-packets"><a href="#3-Data-packets" class="headerlink" title="3. Data packets"></a>3. Data packets</h4><p>The data that needs to be transferred will be divided into several smaller chunks of bits known as <strong>packets(数据包)</strong>, and then each packet will be sent to its destination independently. </p>
<p>Compared to sending large amounts of data in a single packet, sending multiple smaller packets will be more efficient and reliable.</p>
<h4 id="4-TCP"><a href="#4-TCP" class="headerlink" title="4. TCP"></a>4. TCP</h4><p>The primarily used protocol for communication between a web application and a browser is referred to as the <code>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</code>. TCP is a transport layer protocol that takes the responsibility of transmitting data and ensures reliable data transfer between clients and servers across the web. </p>
<p>The way TCP does is by adding additional information to data packets that allow for packet authentication(认证), and by allowing the exchange of acknowledgment messages between the client and server to confirm data transmissions.</p>
<p>The TCP protocol starts with a <code>3-way handshake</code>. The handshake allows both ends (server and client) to initiate and maintain several TCP connections at once.</p>
<img src="/2021/07/13/Web%20Development/Web-Dev-0-A-Primer/3-Way-TCP-Handshake.png" class="">


<h4 id="5-HTTP-amp-HTTPS"><a href="#5-HTTP-amp-HTTPS" class="headerlink" title="5. HTTP &amp; HTTPS"></a>5. HTTP &amp; HTTPS</h4><p>After initiating TCP connections, clients and servers communicate with each other by sending messages to one another. Now, we will look into exactly how these messages are structured.</p>
<p><code>HyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP)</code> is an application layer protocol that dictates the structure of messages exchanged between client and server. It also dictates how messages are exchanged. </p>
<p>HTTP is built on top of TCP. Basically, when you enter a URL in your browser, what actually happens is that an HTTP command gets sent to the server hosting the application to fetch and transmit the requested web page through TCP.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>HTTPS</code> is an acronym for <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure</strong>, and it is basically just the secure version of HTTP. What this means is that communications between the browser and the hosting server are encrypted so that no third parties on the network can access information that is not intended to be shared.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="6-Ports"><a href="#6-Ports" class="headerlink" title="6. Ports"></a>6. Ports</h4><p>HTTP and TCP ensure efficient communication between end-systems on the web, but they don’t determine destination where messages to go. Ports solve this problem.</p>
<p><code>Ports</code> are where messages from the network arrive on an end-system.</p>
<p>We briefly discussed sockets earlier and said they are the gateways to processes. Sockets are opened on ports in order to allow processes to send and receive messages. Ports are designated by numbers, and all ports below 1024 are associated with a specific protocol by default. The port number for HTTP, for instance, is 80, and what this means is that any messages you send or receive on the web come in to and leave your machine on a socket at port 80. Ports above 1024 are open ports available to programmers to use for any process they want to communicate with a network. They can build sockets on these ports, and define the structure and type of messages that this socket can cater to through socket programming. </p>
<p><em>Socket programming</em> is an aspect of Computer Networks, and it is a highly useful skill.</p>
<h3 id="How-Data-Finds-its-Way"><a href="#How-Data-Finds-its-Way" class="headerlink" title="How Data Finds its Way?"></a>How Data Finds its Way?</h3><p>In this part, we will look into how clients and servers know where they want to send their data, and what protocols exist to ensure each end-system on a network has a unique identity that allows it to be reached by other end-systems.</p>
<h4 id="Internet-protocol-amp-IP-addresses"><a href="#Internet-protocol-amp-IP-addresses" class="headerlink" title="Internet protocol &amp; IP addresses"></a>Internet protocol &amp; IP addresses</h4><p><code>Internet Protocol(IP)</code>, is a network layer protocol that is responsible for assigning addresses to devices in order to give them <strong>unique</strong> identities that make them reachable and discoverable. Each device on the Internet has a unique IP address that other devices use to connect with it.</p>
<p>Once you have your website host(托管) on a server, users will be able to connect with it through the <code>IP address</code> of the server and receive data. </p>
<p>You can use the following command line to find your own IP address:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ Linux, macOS: ifconfig<br>$ Windows: ipconfig </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="DNS"><a href="#DNS" class="headerlink" title="DNS"></a>DNS</h4><p>You may be wondering now where the IP address comes in if you reach websites through URLs. Well, that’s where <code>DNS (Domain Name System)</code> comes in. Routers across the web do not store URLs for every single website hosted on the Internet, they only know IP addresses and forward packets towards their destinations based on them. Users, however, only know URLs, or domain names, for the websites they are visiting. To bridge this clear gap of information, the Internet makes use of <strong>DNS servers</strong>, which serve as translational intermediaries between end-systems and the routers that serve to forward data packets coming from them to their destinations. The process of making a lookup for a domain name on a DNS server and obtaining its corresponding IP address is referred to as a <strong>DNS resolution(解析)</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="Vedio-Life-of-a-Packet"><a href="#Vedio-Life-of-a-Packet" class="headerlink" title="Vedio: Life of a Packet"></a>Vedio: Life of a Packet</h3><p>You can watch this vedio: Life of an IP Packet to know exactly how data goes from a client to server. Although some terminology used in it might not exactly be up-to-date, but the underpinnings are essentially the same today. It is a nice overview for beginners.</p>
